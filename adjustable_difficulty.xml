       The final value will also depend on the quantity of meat, etc. but this scale is applied globally. -->
  <predators_smell_distance_scale value="1.0" />

  <!-- WILDLIFE - RESPAWN DELAYS
       Scales for the respawn delay for all wildlife. This has a similar logic as temperature, that is: the scale
       will have its full value (respawn_delay_scale_max) after respawn_delay_scale_day_end but between the starting day
       and the ending day, it will have a ratio of that max value depending on how far along the day is from the starting
       one. Note that if you set a starting day > 1, the scale will have a set value of 1 before that starting day.
       Basically, this allows to set how much the wildlife tend to 'disappear' (how long it takes to come back) as the
       days progress. -->
  <respawn_delay_scale_day_start value="10" />
  <respawn_delay_scale_day_end value="50" />
  <respawn_delay_scale_max value="4.0" />

  <!-- HYPOTHERMIA CURE
       Scale for the delay before an hypothermia is cured. -->
  <hypothermia_cure_delay_scale value="2.0" />

  <!-- FISHING
       This scales the time before a fish is catched, with a similar logic as for temperature and respawn delay: the scale
       will have its full value after the ending day, and before that a ratio of the time spent between the starting end ending day.
       As an example, if you set fishing_catch_scale_day_start to 1, fishing_catch_scale_day_end to 100, and fishing_catch_scale_max
       to 4, then on the 50th day the time before a fish is catched would take twice as long (and on day 100 and later, four times as long). -->
  <fishing_catch_scale_day_start value="10" />
  <fishing_catch_scale_day_end value="50" />
  <fishing_catch_scale_max value="2.0" />

  <!-- WILDLIFE - AMOUNT
       Each of the regions has a set of spawn points (for wolves, bears, deers, and rabbits). For EACH of those spawn points,
       the parameters below scale:
         - The chance of this particular spawn point being active (spawn points can become active or inactive regularly).
         - The max amount of respawns per day for this spawn point.
         - The max amount of simultaneous spawns for this spawn point during the day, and at night.
       The scales are available for each animal. The way they work (by spawn point) can make it a bit tricky to adjust the amount
       of wildlife properly; as such, it may be best to leave those values to 1.0 and use the difficulty settings (pilgrim, voyageur, etc.)
       to tweak this. A further version of the mod should probably include a single scale that adjust the amount of wildlife reliably
       by making changes to these four scales from this single value; but this would require quite a bit of adjusting/testing. -->
